# LSL Definitions

This repository contains the canonical `lsl_definitions.yaml` file that serves as the authoritative source of truth for Second Life's LSL (Linden Scripting Language) library.

## Purpose

The definitions in this file are used to generate code in Second Life's internal systems and provide a single, reliable reference for:

- LSL function signatures and parameters
- Data types and constants
- Documentation and tooltips
- Language specification details

## Usage

This file is primarily intended for:

- **Developers** building LSL-related tools and editors
- **Technical users** who need authoritative LSL language reference
- **Community contributors** improving LSL documentation

## File Format

The definitions are stored in YAML format with structured data describing all aspects of the LSL language specification.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions that improve documentation, fix errors, and enhance tooltips. Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

**Note:** This repository is not the place to request new LSL functions or language features. Such requests should be directed through official Second Life channels.
